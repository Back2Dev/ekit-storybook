    "Q1": "I'm a bridge-building leader. I'm highly relational and not afraid to explore new ways of doing things. I love to \\ninspire people to take action towards a common goal or vision. I'm highly organized and manage through \\nsystems. I like to accomplish work through others and build confidence within the team. I enjoy negotiating \\nconflict and create a positive, energetic environment. I am highly results-oriented and bottom line-oriented. I \\nam also highly communicative. ",
    "Q10": "I don't struggle to recruit people for things that I am passionate about, however I do struggle to ask people to \\nparticipate in something that I am not very excited about. Regarding selecting the right people, I tend to look a \\npersonality more than skill, as you can teach people skills, but you cannot make them be nice. I definitely need \\nto develop in the areas of training and retaining. ",
    "Q11": "My primary controlling issues have to do with holding people accountable, creating systems of feedback, and \\nproviding metrics for success.  I often assume people should have the same strong work ethic that I have and \\nstruggle to know how to respond to people who shirk responsibility or have excuses for poor performance. ",
    "Q12": "One of my strengths is in developing clear vision based upon values or bottom-line goals; however, I'm not \\nalways \"the idea\" person and need to develop strategic ways to create space for \"idea\" people to define the ways \\nwe get to our goal. I also need to develop how I develop others; how to recognize individual gifts and abilities \\nand not expect more than people can produce.",
    "Q13": "I expect to gain tools that can be used in real-life management situations. I'm looking for tools that help me \\nunderstand myself: build on my strengths and buoy my weaknesses.  I also want tools that help me understand \\nothers and develop leaders around me. \\n\\nI will know when these expectations have been met when I have a list of things to change, remove or add to my \\nusual mode of operating. I also hope to create a list of ways to try interacting with others on my team and \\nquestions that will help me assess how each person best operates. ",
    "Q2": "I tend to make quick decisions based on a surface analysis and need to dive deeper before forming an opinion \\nor contriving a solution. I work quickly and have a high sense of urgency--it would likely help my team if I \\nwould relax more and pace myself. I need to continue to learn how to control my time and set priorities. I am \\nmore visionary than detail oriented, and need to be more careful. Sometimes I vocalize criticisms too much.  My \\nhigh level of performance and high standards of excellence can at times set me apart; I find tension within \\nmyself in these moments because I want to be liked. I need to develop my personal definition of what it means \\nto be a leader and find ways to resolve the inner dissonance I feel when I'm out in front. ",
    "Q3": "I want to go as far and as high as I am able at World Vision. I love this work and want to give all that I have to \\noffer towards this cause. I believe my best skills would be utilized in a mobilizing and promoting capacity and \\ncould see myself working with Major Donors or mobilizing church partnerships. ",
    "Q4": "By end of CY 2012:\\nComplete Event Planning Certification\\nRead two books on Experiential Marketing\\nMeet with 8 other World Vision Departments",
    "Q5": "Research Volunteer Applications/Software\\nResearch Project Management/Event Management Software\\nReview Good to Great",
    "Q6": "Most of these goals are of great value, but they have no sense of urgency to complete them. I tend to prioritize \\nbased upon urgency and will need to learn how to prioritize according to long-term, rather than short-term \\nvalue.",
    "Q7": "At times I assume people know more than they do and overestimate that they will come to the same \\nconclusions as me.  I become fearful when dealing with highly aggressive peers; I tend to prefer email or online \\ncommunication with these individuals, but am realizing that usually makes things worse or leaves too much \\nroom for error. ",
    "Q8": "I'm overly optimistic that things will go well, and tend to miss details or fail to plan for the \"what if/s.\"  If an \\nevent or project is exceptionally complicated with a lot of details, I will often fail to communicate important \\ndetails to others because I assume they already know or simply forget. ",
    "Q9": "I love people and will usually choose a social event over getting work accomplished. I need to set up perimeters \\nor boundaries for when and how social activities can interrupt my work day.  I say \"yes\" to more than I have \\ntime to handle well and become frustrated. I have many great ideas and good intentions, but do not have the \\ntime management to follow-through on all of them. ",
