					"Q1" : "I am an analytical, direct, and hands-on manager, as well as a \\nsupportive team player. I employ strategic thinking; my ability to step \\nback while working on a project, allowing for critical checks and \\nbalances, and any needed adjustments during the process; and being able \\nto envision the end result.\\n\\nI encourage participation and get other department employees involved . \\nI ask for and encourage opinions, ensuring that employees feel their \\ncontributions are valued, and make a difference.\\n \\nI am an open and direct communicator; I strive to practice and employ \\neffective communication in the department; and adjust my level of \\ninvolvement and communication depending on the task - whether one on \\none, a small group, or the entire staff. \\n\\nI am always mindful and aware to ensure employees and co-workers are \\nmotivated. To obtain positive cooperation and teamwork, you have to \\nmotivate your employees, knowing and understanding that each employee is \\ndifferent, and must be treated with respect. Listening to them and \\nhelping them with issues, while using constructive criticism, all \\ncontribute to each employee's growth within the organization. \\n\\nWorking hand in hand with employees as a team brings positive \\nreinforcement into the equation. And demonstrates that not only are you \\nwilling to work with them, but show firsthand that you yourself practice \\nwhat you preach - all of this allows you to demand the best from your \\nteam.",
					"Q10" : "I do not currently have a staffing challenge - except for training and \\ndevelopment of current staff/department employees. As stated, I am fairly \\nnew to the organization and would opt to share my views and opinion on this \\nitem after such time that I've had an opportunity to be with the company \\nand its employees a little longer.",
					"Q11" : "Currently, the main controlling challenge I see are accountability, \\nproductivity, efficiency, and quality control. Having recently joined \\nthe company and taken on the duties and responsibilities of managing the \\nwarehouse team, the employees pose the challenge of not having been \\npreviously managed, led, directed, and/or motivated in such a way that \\neach one knows and takes ownership of his duties and tasks. The \\nemployees need to be shown efficient and effective ways to handle \\nissues, thus controlling costs and eliminating unnecessary double work. \\nAll this in turn will improve the service levels provided to customers \\nand delivering on the promise of unparalleled service in the industry.",
					"Q12" : "Although it remains too early to determine the main leading challenges \\nat this time; I foresee my person leading challenges to come as a result \\nof taking on too many projects at the same time. I am a doer, very \\nresults driven and focused on presenting solutions to issues. This \\nmentality may result in wanting to solve all the issues as soon as \\npossible; which sometimes may not be feasible, given the fact that some \\nsteps and solutions will require time and cycles to become fully \\nresolved. I will need to strive harder in allowing time for solutions \\nand action plans to mature and assume full implementation across the \\nareas or departments before critiquing the end results.",

Full expectations will include employees who look to be \\nat 100% performance of their job responsibilities and take great pride \\nin what the team accomplishes as a whole unit.",
					"Q2" : "It's sometimes difficult to be completely objective when critiquing \\noneself, as I devote my energies and direct my focus on performing work \\nand actions that I can stand behind, confident that I do my best, to the \\nbest of my abilities and what I understand to be the best action for the \\ncompany's goals; however, I am mindful that opportunities for growth and \\nimprovement exist. \\n\\nIn my opinion, I need to work on being able to trust my staff more. \\nWhile working on a project or critical tasks, I often find myself \\nusually double checking other people's work, or making sure that nothing \\nwas missed. This sometimes pulls me away from other tasks and duties. I \\nneed to learn how to trust others with their assigned tasks and \\nresponsibilities. ",
					"Q3" : "I take pride in what I do and I always strive to perform my best, at any \\ntask and at any level. I am the type of manager/employee who cares about \\nthe company as well as fellow employees and co-workers alike. \\n\\nBeing a recent addition to the team, my immediate goal is to learn the \\ninner workings of the business, absorb as much information and data as \\nneeded to be able to perform my duties and responsibilities with high \\nlevels of efficiency, while imparting my previous career experience and \\nknowledge to effect more streamlined processes, creating procedures, \\ntraining team members and department employees, providing support in \\nareas of my expertise, and contributing to the companies' overall growth \\nand development, furthering the company goal of being the leader in the \\nindustry.\\n\\nI made the career move to not only work with the companies; but to \\nfirmly plant myself within the team, become an integral part of the \\norganization, one who's valued for his contributions and highly regarded \\nas being trustworthy, dependable, a dedicated member of the team, and \\nwill do what it takes to get the job done. My personal career goal is to \\n with the company. ",
					"Q4" : "At this time, the immediate need is to create new processes and \\nprocedures across the company in the  areas that I am responsible for, \\nand other areas that have the critical need for improvement. \\n\\nThe first year's measurable goal is to improve the overall efficiency of \\nthe company, reducing waste or unproductive time and eliminating double \\nwork or having to double-back to correct mistakes, in effect, making the \\norganization a more profitable one. ",
					"Q5" : "I am currently working on immediately achievable short term goals that \\nare relative to my job responsibilities, such as: \\n1) Setting up a new warehouse(to include space layout, procedures, \\netc.); \\n2) Improving the current RMA process that the company utilizes; \\n3) Creating specific job descriptions for each employee in the \\ndepartment, thereby making each employee more accountable of their \\nindividual responsibilities. \\n\\nAll of these goals are driven towards making the department more smooth \\nrunning, efficient and cost effective. ",
					"Q6" : "Currently, there are 2 significant challenges to achieving the above \\nimmediate department goals:\\n\\n1) Existing personnel - as is expected and common with any new manager, \\nthere exists some push back and negativity from certain employees. I \\nmust and will continue to engage in open communication, employ active \\nparticipation and monitoring on tasks and duties, while demonstrating \\nfirm, quick actions, and fair decisions on any situations that may arise\\n\\n2) Industry specific technical information - as I continue to gain more \\nknowledge and familiarity with industry and business specific technology \\nand data, I will grow my confidence in suggesting steps and sharing \\nsolutions to further streamline and improve upon processes and \\nprocedures, effecting in lowering costs, hence impacting positively on \\nthe bottom line.",
					"Q7" : "Although I try my best to be understanding and mindful of others, I \\nsometimes feel my direct approach can be misunderstood for being brusque or \\nrude. ",
					"Q8" : "With regards to planning challenges, I foresee my main challenge as \\nattempting to take on too many things at the same time, due to the enormity \\nof the tasks. With the goal of solving issues as quickly as possible, I can \\nbecome too focused on the end result and quickly add too many items to my \\nplate, sometimes not realizing that to effectively resolve issues or lay \\nsolutions, one must resolve core deficiencies first.",
					"Q9" : "I currently do not see (or experience) any organizing challenges - I am \\nfairly new to the position and company and would rather wait until a later \\ntime to be able to provide a more accurate analysis and feedback on this \\nitem.",

					"Q10" : "In my role as an HR Manager, I believe I have two primary challenges:\\n- generating buy in from two employees that do not see me as the lead for the \\ndepartment.  One person has felt threatened since I moved into HR, and I have \\nworked hard to calm their fears.  The other person is a stronger personality \\nthat struggles to work with a group.  Neither want to report to me.\\n- I also need to improve in owning responsibility for the department's success.  \\nThe department is lean (5 HR people for 275 employees), and I need to have a \\nclearer view of the department's needs, and our employee's needs.",
					"Q11" : "- Follow-through on all my obligations.  I've been challenged (and grown \\nsignificantly) by the fact in HR you are spinning so many plates, and relying on \\nothers to close out tasks.\\n- Finding balance in my work and life.  Planning ahead, delegating, empowering, \\nso that I don't have to control everything.  This can be summarized simply as \\nlearning to let go, and good enough to move on.",
					"Q12" : "- Being clear and committed in my vision for the department's success.  Whether \\nin HR or project management, I need to have resolve and communicate clear with \\nthe team our Why, What, and How.\\n- In HR, I've struggled to get the team to work more cohesively.  We've moved the \\nneedle a little, but we have a long way to go.",
					"Q13" : "I'm looking forward to gaining outside perspective.  I welcome feedback, \\nconstructive and critical.\\n\\nI hope to become a better leader by becoming more sure in my beliefs and clearer \\nin my messaging.  I hope to become a leader that others want to work with.",
					"Q2" : "Delegating and empowering others.\\nAsking questions and listening more.\\nNegotiation.\\nReceiving criticism and implementing feedback more.",
					"Q3" : "In limbo as I am evaluating moving back into project management.  My ultimate \\ngoal is to make an impact in the organization and in people's lives.  I can do \\nthat either through a path in Human Resources / Industrial Organization or via \\nProject Management.",
					"Q4" : "- Increase intern retention and hire rate by 5%.\\n- Develop a strategy and job descriptions for various HR positions on a local and \\nnational level by 9/1.\\n- Launch a DEI committee in the local office by end of 2022.\\n- Generate a fully-functional recruiting spreadsheet by 9/1.",
					"Q5" : "- Extend full time and part time offers.  Achieve 75% - 80% conversion rate.\\n- Generate buy in from the (Chief HR) search committee; start sourcing candidates \\nby 12/1.\\n- Roll out the recruiting spreadsheet by 9/1.",
					"Q6" : "My major obstacles are related to time.  Late summer/fall is dedicated to \\nsigning interns and full-time salaried employees.\\n\\nI need to improve in delegating.  There is certain work that I need to own \\n(managing all recruiting efforts), but I need to generate more support and get \\nothers in the company to assist in the actual interviews.\\n\\nI will also need to resist signing up for extra work.  I'm generally one that \\nloves to help others, which often results in adding more to my to-do list.",
					"Q7" : "Curse of knowledge.  If I know something, I assume others do as well.\\n\\nIn general, I believe I consistently meet with my direct and indirect reports, \\nand strive to generate structure.  I try to quickly move-through meetings \\n(especially in group meetings), which will sometimes be a benefit and a \\nhindrance.\\n\\nI also struggle to generate buy-in on tasks that are not normal \\nresponsibilities.  I.e. I don't think I'm persuasive; and much of my HR \\nfunctions require me to lean on others outside of my department to accomplish \\ntasks.\\n\\nI have been told before that I am a bad-listener, as I cut some people off.  I \\nbelieve this is because I have a sense of urgency in everything I do.",
					"Q8" : "I believe I'm fairly effective with planning for my own tasks/responsibilities.  \\nI take on a large burden, sometimes trying to accomplish too much with congruent \\ndeadlines.\\n\\nOne struggle is that I often put the projects of others above my own. I love to \\nhelp others succeed; but then is sometimes at the detriment of my own tasks.",
					"Q9" : "As mentioned above, I struggle with asking for help or generating buy-in from \\nothers not in my department.  This is something I am working through.\\n\\nMy own time-management could be improved.  I tend to take on a lot of \\nresponsibility and don't always dedicate the appropriate amount of time to \\ncomplete my tasks.",

We need to find ways to support Roth & our BOH management team to ensure that through \\nproper training, development, constant & consistent communication, leadership & expectations - we are able to \\nsee measurable growth in retaining great employees.  We also are in the process of figuring out how to pay our \\nBOH employees a higher wage to attract & keep great employees.  Montana has a very high minimum wage & no \\ntip credit.  Therefor, there is a huge disparity between FOH & BOH wages.",

That being said, Roth is continuosly working on improving his communicaiton tone and style & it \\nshows.  Roth can continue to improve his communication style & see even more positive results.  Because Roth \\nknows that his communication style has come under scrutiny, I think he sometimes shies away from managing \\nour BOH managers to the same severity & degree that FOH managers receive.

Roth's message - which 9 times out of 10 is \\ncorrect, can often get lost in tone & through intimidation.  Roth's passion for our business is often communicated \\n(outwardly) differently than how he feels (inwardly).  In  short - lost in translation.  One of the hardest things in \\nownership & management is to create a team around you that is or is on a path at actually being better than you! \\nRoth's frustrations & how he communicates those frustrations sometimes get in the way of the growth of our \\nmanagement team.",

					"Q10" : "Recruiting.  \\nFinding the right people.\\nTraining the people once they're hired (training my assistant project manager \\nand my project engineer is a big part of my current position as they both \\nstarted in the last 2 months.)\\nFinding people who are able and willing to do both the engineering tasks and \\nhave the ability to work with clients (otherwise I become the conduit to all \\nthe clients).",
					"Q11" : "Quality / Time issue: I see a bottleneck created in that I am required to \\nreview all deliverables in detail before sending them out to the client or to \\nmy director of engineering for review and I will frequently get backlogged to \\ndo meaningful reviews by my 2 engineers and 2 drafters. This will get better as \\nmy APM and PE get further along in their training in their respective \\npositions, but it's painful right now.\\n\\n2nd bottleneck is the amount of time required for me to a project \\nto be worked on by my APM or PE so they know where all the information they \\nneed is and what they need to do.  This also will get better as they get \\nfurther along in their training.  \\n\\nAnother item that comes to mind is a minor Quality item, my drafters typically \\nget about 95% of the red marked corrections with each drawing revision, which \\nthen causes our drawing generation process to take at least 2 passes of \\nrevisions before drawing deliverables can be sent out.",
					"Q12" : "An issue I see is to provide detailed project schedules to my team each week by \\nCOB on Friday so that they all have a clear vision of what needs to be done the \\nfollowing week.  Currently I'll send them each out an email on Monday morning \\ndetailing what they're working on for that week, but that does not seem to be \\nas effective as an overall schedule showing what we're all working on that \\nweek.\\n\\nMy APM appear to be fearful at times of asking clarifying questions.  This \\nseems to be getting better as we continue to work together, but there are times \\nhe will do work in a direction that is not needed which adds time to the task \\nor not get the details completed as are needed by the project requirements, and \\nit takes extra time to do a corrective step to revise the information.  ",
					"Q13" : "I hope to learn how to better define, refine, and articulate the goals and \\nmetrics for my position so that I can do a better job of measuring them and \\nbecome a more effective leader for my team.

",
					"Q7" : "Style/Effectiveness.  Being careful to not provide too much detail - or to \\nsplit up my email into a bullet point summary followed by details if needed.  \\nAlso depends on the audience that the email is being sent to.  \\n\\nPatience with those for whom English is not their 1st language.  This is a \\ntypical issue in engineering, just need to remember that it will take longer \\nthan I anticipate to communicate information and will likely take additional \\nfollow up discussions (that take time) to provide clarification and get \\nconfirmation that the information was understood.

Trying to control this in an environment with an \\nunpredictable supply base, much of which doesn't execute/perform well, makes it \\nextremely difficult to control.  She can't be everywhere all the time;  she has \\nto look at the high level trends, and then the elements that are \\ndriving performance to be off in her key KPI areas.  She has to practice rigor \\nin routine, make problems visible to those who are accountable, \\nand drive effective action on the 20% of items that will drive 80% of the \\nimprovement.",

She needs to continue to inspire change, and inspire everyone to.  She also needs to forge a strong sense of teamwork between the \\nsupply chain team and Sales, Product Management, Pricing, Operations, and \\nFinance, as well as our key Supplier Partners.

This makes planning very difficult \\nbecause we rarely have the full story on what to expect in terms of delivery, \\nlead times, etc.",

She's trying to position herself as more of a strategic \\nleader, but weak people, processes, and tools are a barrier.

Sean walks \\nthis line between good-guy friendly boss, to the do great work just don't f-it \\nup kind of boss, I think at times \\nthat style of management is effective at keeping people on task, having fun & \\nworking hard; but I also think it \\ncan do some damage with people when they don't know how to read Sean and which \\nboss they have at that \\nmoment. (ie. a staff member joking around because they think they have 'fun' \\nSean only to find out they have \\nbusy  Sean, which can show in frustration on Sean).    ",
					"Q3" : "Sean handles communication very well.  The challenges that he faces are when he \\nis at the end of his week, \\ntired, fried, whatever you want to call it.  That is when communication can get \\nshorter, more aggressive in tone.  \\nIntentions are always good, it is just something that is physically visible in \\nhim after long, challenging weeks.  At \\ntimes we have been asked to not communicate some things, for example see if a \\nmanager/staff member will \\nfollow up on their own and show the initiative.  I absolutely understand this \\napproach, but it also has damaging \\neffects on the   communication between the people involved in the situation, \\nsometimes the effectiveness of the \\noutcome & the fact that if anyone finds out about the request to not \\ncommunicate, it feels like a lack of trust or \\na game.  I think Sean works hard to protect all of us from situations, but in \\nthe end maybe he shouldn't so we can work \\nthrough them as a team, build better cohesion and communication.",
					"Q4" : "Sean is very good at working out the steps needed to handle the challenges \\nfaced in planning out our \\noperations. There is always opportunity for improvement; ie. more open \\ncommunication with regards to goals, direction, \\ngrowth, plans, future goals & plans etc.  There has always been a very big \\nseparation between the 'need to know \\n& when' from the ownership group down, which tends to leave the management team \\nin the world of  Taking it down to the next level it has an \\nnegative effect on the goals & direction for \\nyour managers as well, because we are always wondering Which has a \\ntrickle down effect to the rest of the staff when we talk about how much they \\nwill trust our overall cohesion as a \\nmanagement team and follow us to the desired level of job expectations.  This \\nis exaggerated of course, but \\ndeep down every employee wants more feedback about how we are doing, if we are \\ndoing what you want/need us to \\nbe doing, and if we are doing it well enough/if we need to improve/etc.  If \\nclarity & open communication about the \\nplans & goals of our actions starts at the top and truly carries down to every \\nmanager & staff member equally, \\nthen we will have the opportunity to talk about real growth & effectiveness.  \\nIn the end, we would all be able to plan \\nbetter, and ideally manage better.  ",

This is one \\nof his stronger suits, as he is very good at reading people, their needs and \\nhow to communicate what is needed out of them at any given moment.  I do think \\nthere is a total lack of training for your management team.  There is no \\nstandard training process for the staff or future managers, there are a lot of \\ndouble standards in the operations regarding expectations of managers depending \\non their department; all things that lead to a less effective management team \\nthat is harder to manage and guide because the message, training & development \\nof the staff is muddled or non-existent.",

Trying to juggle the needs \\nof the ownership group, the managers, the staff & the business in general make \\nit hard to keep those control factors consistent.  I would humbly suggest more \\nopen communication, direct feedback in the moment, corrective action in the \\nmoment instead of letting it build; all things which could really help the \\naccountability factor on his end & the awareness, goals & expectations for the \\nmanagers & crew.",
					"Q8" : "I think his team goals are fairly clear for all of us, he motivates well & guides \\nthe team very well.  The transition he is in going from the management team to \\nownership has been a shift in systems for all of us little bit, including him.  \\nAnd it shows as we are all figuring out how to navigate & communicate \\ndifferently.  We cold all use clearer vision with regards to our performance, \\nopportunities for improvement, goals, direction, long term goals & plans, etc.   ",
					"Q9" : "You are going through a personal transition & the building is still going \\nthrough a professional transition in-terms of the \\nmanagement/ownership team.  Recognize the impact you have daily in the \\nbuilding, especially at the end of your weeks when your \\npatience runs thin.  That is when your communication can get short & stressed \\nand it can impact your ability to be the bad-ass you \\nnormally are.  Be more direct & open with your communication to keep your staff \\ninformed, delegate more responsibility to your team \\nto free yourself up to be more effective, & trust in us to deliver on the \\nexpectations set for us.  Act more in the moment: \\ncommunicating solutions to challenges, opportunities for improvement, \\ncorrective actions, etc. so they don't build up and become \\nlarger challenges than they need to be.  Keep protecting your staff, but not at \\nthe detriment to the staff.  We need the \\nopportunities to work out the challenges we face as a team if we are to really \\nbuild better cohesion and teamwork.  Lastly, we all \\nwork hard to placate the emotional & reactionary nature of one of our owners; \\nin the end it is a process that will take time to \\nhelp correct, but in the meantime we all carry a lot of stress associated with \\nthis scenario, so much so that it makes us less \\nefficient as a team, work harder to run this operation & add a lot of baggage \\nto all of our plates.  One of our policies is to \\nLeave it at the Door, so it feels that it is a double standard in terms of our \\nexpectations if our model from on top is not held to \\nthe same expectations we are as a cohesive team.  Thank you for the support and \\ncare you have shown to the management team, it \\nwould not be the successful operation it is today without you.",

Consistent communication and monitoring Sean's performance and getting a \\nbarometer from his management team will enable us to gage what he learned through MAP . We have a lot of \\nfaith and confidence in Sean and his ability to learn, grow and succeed in his expanded role. ",
					"Q2" : "He needs to continue working on being more direct and concise in his communication, but has made great \\nstrides in the past two years in this area. This has directly contributed to greater management effectiveness and \\nincreased confidence because of it. Mastering clear and direct communication skills, and having the courage of \\nhis convictions, are key components to successful managing and healthy partner relations.",
					"Q3" : "The goal is to have Sean reduce his floor shifts to a maximum of two/weekly in 2017, allowing him to focus  on \\nlarger management and owner duties. Achieving this will depend on increasing mgmt depth, along with the \\nfurther development and training of the current management team which will allow Sean to confidently delegate \\nsome of his current duties. Then Sean can begin his next phase of his owner development. The business just \\ncompleted a major kitchen expansion & remodel requiring a substantial investment (1.2MM). As a new owner, \\nSean must learn the larger financial ramifications of the business. His financial comprehension of all the \\ncomponents (not just operational finances, but business loans etc.) is a high priority in his development. Under \\nhis watch as GM since late 2013, the business has seen its highest profitability. Sean�s financial performance will \\ncontinue to be measured through maintaining set monthly profitability, cost of goods & labor goals, and \\nmanagement development.\\n",
					"Q4" : "Training in a new FOH manager (already identified in-house) begins immediately. Sean will be taking an active \\nrole in this training by coaching and mentoring the managers who are directly carrying out the training protocol \\non a daily basis. He must keep trainers accountable for consistently teaching our training procedures. Sean's \\nability to adjust and manage for the reduced sales volume in the fourth quarter is also a high priority. Assisting \\nMark and Roth with tweaking the mgt bonus program is another goal for this period. Sean�s performance will \\ncontinue to be measured through maintaining set monthly profitability, cost of goods & labor goals, and \\nmanagement development.\\n",
					"Q5" : "Getting spread too thin is a concern. Sean�s success depends on developing improved time management skills \\n(to account for the increased ownership duties). The ability to confidently delegate with support will become \\nmore important than ever. Prioritizing his task list and giving each task the appropriate amount of his energy \\nbased on importance will contribute greatly to his growth. Additional owner responsibilities will change the \\ngame for Sean. Thus his success depends on his management team's growth under his direction, so managers \\ncan confidently step up and absorb some of his day-to-day duties. Accomplishing this is key to accelerate \\nSean's development as a GM/Partner.  ",
					"Q6" : "Sean desires to increase his ownership interest over time . He knows that for this to be a solid long term \\ninvestment, he must help elevate operations through improved systems and accountability to ensure the \\nrestaurant stays relevant in the market and continues to be profitable into the future. Christin and I continue to \\nstress and impress upon Sean and Roth that they are the future of Montana Ale Works, and must actively \\ndevelop their management and leadership skills to ensure their success as business owners, leaders and \\nmentors. ",
					"Q7" : "Developing an �owner communication voice� is key in the coming months to make Sean a more  effective \\npartner. Sean is already learning how to effectively contribute as a partner, not just a GM, and we are actively \\nencouraging him to speak up, speak his mind, find his voice with us, but do so in a way that is prepared and \\nbacked up with stats and examples to enable the partnership to make informed decisions from his suggestions. \\nThorough preparation and solid data to support his position on issues (Christin and I have for years been the \\nproviders of such stats and information) will be an important step and give him confidence when presenting to \\nthe group. Learning to wear two hats � owner and GM � is the new challenge for Sean. He must learn to \\nobjectively assess his performance as a GM when wearing his owner hat. In addition, he needs to understand \\nhow an owner's communication style usually needs to be more consciously diplomatic and with broader \\nperspective (to staff, guests and vendors). He needs to recognize his position and stature as seen through their \\neyes now.  His megaphone his bigger. Learning to view the business more globally � i.e. understanding the \\nlarger impact of even small decisions � will help him in this regard.",
					"Q8" : "Planning and decision-making is increased as a new owner. Sean�s ability to set long and short-term goals for \\nhimself and his team will help them accomplish our game plan for the upcoming year and keep the team on \\ntask.  As a GM/partner Sean is now you ultimately accountable for the entire operation. Sean seems to recognize \\nthe increased level of responsibility and has embraced it. He has developed a strong allegiance and working \\nrelationship with his on-premise partner Roth in the past year (since being offered ownership). Working as a \\nunified team and continuing to develop their working relationship is KEY to their success (i.e. establishing who \\nhas authority where; With whom does the buck stop in the bldg?; How are differences in opinion resolved?)",
					"Q9" : "As a new owner, Sean will need to manage his finances differently. This requires, in my opinion,  a financial \\nadvisor to help him better forecast and manage his personal and professional financial responsibilities. \\nUnderstanding and managing business and personal finances takes another level of planning... Sean will need to \\ncommit to his financial planning and utilize his resources to help him stay on track. As a new owner, improving \\nhis organizational skills (juggling family time, Sean time and work) is a priority to protect his sanity and \\neffectiveness. Effective time management is a core value of the business and is key to Sean�s personal and \\nprofessional success.",
