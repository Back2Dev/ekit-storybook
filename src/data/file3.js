    "Q1": "I think my strength is that I have strong connections with those I work with.  I strive to motivate and support those around me.  I also think that I organize myself well and that this allows me to juggle many things at once.  ",
    "Q10": "As I mentioned in question 8 I could have done a more effective job recruiting staff to have replacements filled more timely.  ",
    "Q11": "My greatest challenge is in our teams quality.  Our quality audits are completed annually and so I am hopeful with the staffing changes and monthly feedback that has been given to each of the reps that our audit in November will show an improvement over last years results.  \\nI also have found a challenge in controlling our IA costs and controlling those expenses.  ",
    "Q12": "Perhaps, I can benefit from adding an innovative or different and more creative approach to solving issues for my team.  ",
    "Q13": "I look forward to the feedback from those I know and work with on a daily basis.  I also look forward to learning about others perceptions of me and of my strengths and opportunities.   My expectations will be met if I am able to adjust my opportunities and allow for an optimal work environment for those around me.\\nI would also like to see if there are new ways that I can streamline my communication with my team about our work product.  ",
    "Q2": "I think that I can do a better job listening to my direct reports.  I think that I can also do better delegating tasks.  I think that I can improve in recognizing my team for their successes.  ",
    "Q3": "I enjoy what I am doing but would like to further my technical knowledge and also become cross trained in the casualty side of the business.  ",
    "Q4": "An 88% Satisfactory audit score.\\n72 Subrogation recoveries. \\n95% Customer Service.\\n$375 Cost per Claim.  ",
    "Q5": "88% management audit scores in monthly audits. Continue to audit files, provide feedback and have open discussions with team regarding the audit findings.  \\n7 subrogation recoveries per month, continue to work with team to refer the appropriate files to the subrogation department.  \\n98% customer survey to offset my YTD results of 92%\\nachieve below the $375 cost per claim by minimizing IA use.  ",
    "Q6": "Addressing customer service and leading by example.  Leadership begins with me and my example, If I portray a positive outlook regarding our clients then the reps should also be motivated to treat our clients respectfully.  If there are specific individuals who need motivation or assistance, then I need to address that issue timely and professionally.  ",
    "Q7": "I would say frequency.  Although I hold weekly team meetings and strive to be assessable, I wish I had more time to proactively follow up with each on my direct reports one on one.  ",
    "Q8": "In the last year my team has experienced some turnover.  I think if I had done a better job recruiting potential replacements before the turnover occurred that my team would have been less affected and interrupted by the turnover.  This was poor planning on my part.  ",
    "Q9": "I would say equipment.  I think that when a team member experiences a computer hardware issue it takes too much time to have this addressed and to fix the issue.  ",
